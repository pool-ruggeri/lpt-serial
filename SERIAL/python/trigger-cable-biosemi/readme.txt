Script tested with Raspberry Pi 5, using BioSemi trigger cable https://www.biosemi.com/faq/USB%20Trigger%20interface%20cable.htm connected to a BioSemi amplifier. Inspired by the script available online on the BioSemi forum https://www.biosemi.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1571.

Requires `import serial` from the PySerial library.

Replacing the BioSemi trigger cable with MMBTS from Neurospec should work, but the baud rate should be set to 9600. Instruction manual: https://www.neurospec.com/Content/Uploads/1067/MMBT-S_instruction_manual_v2.2.pdf
