README to configure LPT port

1) Install LPT on motherboard and make sure that the OS recognize it. Install the drivers as well
2) Install Win32 drivers for InpOut downloaded from http://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32; download binaries and then look for the exe
....\InpOutBinaries_1501\Win32\InstallDriver.exe
3) Look in the gestionnaire de peripherique for the HEX of the LTP (usually the first one under E/S, like "E010")
4) Test the LPT with the LPTTestUtility. Make sure that the inpout32.dll is in the same folder. Open the app and enter the HEX adress under LTP X: It should recognize the card
5) test it with Actiview of BIOSEMI to see if the usb2receiver receivs triggers
6) If yes, test it with python scripts. Make sure that the psychopy folder of the executable contains the inpout 32 and 64 DLL. Otherwise you get a parallel port error when running the scripts
